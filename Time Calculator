Python

There are 60 seconds in a minute. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 60, 
the program should convert the number of seconds to minutes and seconds. There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. 
If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 3,600, the program should convert the 
number of seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds. There are 86,400 seconds in a day. If the number of seconds entered by the 
user is greater than or equal to 86,400, the program should convert the number of seconds to days, hours, minutes, and seconds. 

Note â€“ use the % operator in your calculations.
